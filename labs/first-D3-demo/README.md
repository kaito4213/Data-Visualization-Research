===
*By Jiaoyan Chen*

Description
---
* Use D3 to generate circles, lines and polygons with different sizes and different colors. Draw two different pictures using the same pieces. Users can change the picture by clicking the button. The idea comes from Tangram: a Chinese geometric puzzle consisting of a square cut into seven pieces that can be arranged to make various other shapes.
