### Description
In this research, we are going to identify the importance of features in regression models. The simple and direct way people can think about is plotting relationship between the observation and prediction variable and selecting the more important ones. In the experiment, we make several scatter plots to visualize the relationship of each feature and the dependent variable which is the value we are trying to predicating by model. And then we make a web survey which contains the scatter plots and asks people to rank the importance of features based on these plots. In this experiment, we collect peopleâ€™s opinions and compared with standardized regression coefficients in multiple linear model[12] and features selected by lasso regression models. We are trying to find out whether the features selection can be observed by human perception.
