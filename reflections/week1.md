This article contains six maps which show the massive scope of America's infrastructure. President Trump plans to invest about $550 billion in new infrastructure project and these map provide a glimpse into where half trillion dollars may be invested. This is a popular political and social topic as many people concerned about.

These maps shows electric grid, bridges in need of repair, pipelines, railroads, airports and maritime traffic. Some maps also provided with submap to see the detailed information. Basically, all the six maps use path to show the information. But the design varies from one to another.

In the electric grid, the paths are all marked in purple which represents the electric transmission lines. It is also provided with submaps that show the location of power plants, which generate the power from coral, natural gas, hydropower and wind. These four maps are listed close to each other so it helps us get more information by comparing them. The multi-power plants distribution implied that maybe the government investment in the electrical infrastructure is not necessary.

In the bridges maps, which marked as red means that the bridge has one or more structural defects that require attention. We can see the bridge quality condition of each area by the density of red dots. In the pipelines map, crude oil pipelines and natural gas pipelines are marked in different colors. From the map, we can clearly see where the source comes from. The maps of railroads, airports and waterways show the main stations in dots. This helps us to filter trivial information.

As we can seen from all there maps, the solusion of improving the infrastructure is really complex. One solution doesn't fit all. Different kinds of infrastructure have different kinds of needs.
