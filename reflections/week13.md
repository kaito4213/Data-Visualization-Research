### OVERVIEW
This paper proposes a classification of information visualization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique, and the interaction and distortion technique. It is aimed at taking the advantage of visual data exploration that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. So Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. Visual data exploration has high potential and many applications, such as fraud detection and data mining, will use information visualization technology for an improved data analysis.



### Three Things I liked about this paper:
* It offers specific visualization technology for reader to visualize one-dimensional, two-dimensional and multi-dimensional data.

* It gives reader good example in visual different data type, which can be helpful to understand the idea.

* In addition to the visualization technique, for an effective data exploration, it provides some necessary interaction and distortion techniques.

### Three Things need to be changed:
* The interaction part will be better if author explains when and what type data these interactions can be used to achieve better result.

* It should involve more content about the tight integration of visualization techniques with traditional techniques from such disciplines as statistics, machine learning, operations research, and simulation.

* The geographic data is commenly to be used everywhere. It better includes how to visualize it in this paper.
