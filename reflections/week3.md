This data visualization explored those international connections through Facebook and found some trends — some predictable, some wholly unexpected, and some still inexplicable. It is a project visualizing the degree of interconnectedness between Facebook's hundreds of millions of members as part of Facebook's new Stories initiative.

The cool thing about this idea is you can explore the story by yourself. The author didn't aim to tell you what he hound. As you explore this interactive map, you can click any nation in the world, and see the top five closest nations based on friendship connections. The author pull out intriguing stories and anomalies at the bottom of the map, helping people understand the non-obvious connections.

Countries are sorted by a combination of how many Facebook friendships there are between countries, and the total number of Facebook friendships there are in that country. Turns out this number can tell you some pretty interesting things about not just where a country is now, but where it's been. The Marshall Islands shows strong results in the immediate geographic area—Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji—but the number one result is to the United States, over 4600 miles away, since the islands were occupied by the United States until 1986.

Another thing that interests me is that when you click the countary, it shows it's five connections, then you choose one of the five connection, another five new connections shows and you can repeat doing that. This map has the same view Stanley Milgram's "six degrees of separation" theory on its head and showed that we're a lot closer than you might think.
