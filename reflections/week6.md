This example is about the very sad reality of the Ebola epidemic and the sadder still inaction by governments. It shows the low and high estimates of infections of Ebola due to this terrible disease. It also allows us to predict what would happen if we delay action, by moving the blue dot on the graph. 

We can tell a lot of stories from this visualization. This is really awesome.

Ignore the black line for a moment (it shows the actual reported cases of infection). The graph shows the predictions of what would have happened if aggressive intervention started in June 2014. The high and low estimates of cases, as you can see below, would have been much, much lower than reality.

We can also found in the gragh that contries with the money, resources and knowledge to deal with an Ebola type epidemic did not come to the rescue of the African countries as fast as you might have expected. At that time these countries had models to predict what was the cost in human lives from inaction. Approximately 12k additional deaths. Very close to what happened in reality.

It is important to note that the high estimate includes deaths experts believe have been underreported. At that time we could also have move the slider further ahead to model out the impact of inaction.You can see that moving in Aug did have an impact, the black line, reported cases is less worse than it could have been. Even assuming that 12k is a lower number (lots of people don't report the disease). It also does not include the other countries beyond Liberia and Sierra Leone where we know infections and deaths have occurred.
