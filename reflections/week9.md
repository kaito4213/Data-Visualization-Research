The Homicide Monitor, produced by Brazilian-NGO the Igarape Institute, is the most comprehensive publicly-available dataset on murder in the world. It shows that 437,000 people are killed globally each year. It includes data for more than 219 countries, dependencies and territories in 2000-2012. For Latin America and the Caribbean it also includes sub-national data on states and cities with populations over 250,000 people.

The data show a small number of countries account for a disproportionately large share of the global burden of murder. In 2012, the latest date for which relatively comprehensive information is available, one out of every four people violently killed each year around the world—outside ongoing war zones—was either Brazilian, Colombian, Mexican, or Venezuelan.
