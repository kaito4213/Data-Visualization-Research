This visualization is trying to show the US gun deaths in 2010 and 2013 in detail. It is made of thousands of paths and each path consists of two parts shows a person's life journey. The orange part shows his real life labeled the person's name and when he was killed, then the path turned grey. The grey path represents the years the person could have lived if he didn't be killed. This part is labeled with who killed the person and how he was killed. Interestingly, it also shows the prediciton of how long will the person live and the cause of his natural death.

There are two good patterns in this visualization from my view. The first one is the animation. This page opens with a thin orange line that arcs over a black background. Suddenly, the path halts and a dot drops to the baseline, which indicated the person was killed by gun. An instant later, the left side of the baseline turns into a punctured hose sputtering hundreds, thousands of lines. This truncates the presentation time since there's no need to repeat the life paths to viewers. After all the lines sputterd, viewers can choose one specific line and learn more about the killed person from labels. 

Secondly, I want to talk about the filter in the bottom of this page. The animation provides an overall presentation. But all lines crisscrossed, which is hard to group the information. The filter helps presenting different types of gun death, victims race, age group etc. But it doesn't hide the overview of the gun death. The filtered group shows upside of the baseline and the overview is moved to upside. So it is a good idea to make the comparison. You can learn how many parts of chosen gun deaths group among the total deaths. I chose to see how many females over 30 were died in gun killing in 2010. The visualization is shown as below: you can see the ratio of this group.

Apart from the good patterns, the main weakness is the prediction cannot convince me since there's no detail information about how the stolen year of each person was computed by the author, though it is interesting and creative.
