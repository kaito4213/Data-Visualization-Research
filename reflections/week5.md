The interactive map shows where U.S. immigrants came from over the past 200 years, measured as a percentage of the U.S. population at the time. This chart visualizes all of them based on their prior country of residence. The brightness of a country corresponds to its total migration to the U.S. at the given time. Each dot represents 10,000 people. The 79 million people who immigrated to the U.S. during that period only include those who became permanent legal residents.

There are several good pattern about this visualization:
- Users can control the map at the bottom to stop or resume the animation or to move back and forth in time.
- The information about total migration and top countries is updated every ten years corresponding to the animation.
- The brightness of a country is changed as the time going.
- The orbit of a dot is speeding when more and more people immigrate to the U.S.

However, the interactive map can still be improved by:
- Changing the saturation of the highlighted countries to make a better design.
- Enabling user to speed the animation.
